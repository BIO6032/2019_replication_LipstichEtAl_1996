# Replication Study

## This repository's goal is to replicate an epidemiological model for the evolution of virulence by Lipsitch et al. (1996) presenting trade-offs between horizontal and vertical transmission of pathogens.

The original article can be found in the file "Lipsitch_1995.pdf".

Julia Lang scripts defining model parameters (as found in the original study) are available in the folder "Model_scripts".

All figures produced for the replication study are found in their respective folders.
